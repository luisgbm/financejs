# How to use the app

Finance is a personal finance manager that lets you keep track of your transactions. But before we get there, we need to
setup a few things first.

## Categories

The first thing to do when you log into Finance is to create a few categories.

Categories can be of two types: Expenses and Incomes. Expenses are things you spend money on, like Food, or your Car.
Incomes are things from which you earn money, like the Salary from your job, or Earnings from the stock market.

## Accounts

Transactions belong into accounts, so the next thing to do is to create a few accounts. These can be your Bank account,
your Credit Card, or even your Wallet for cash transactions.

## Transactions

With categories and accounts, you can now create a transaction. A transaction has a value, a category, a date, and
optionally a description. If you create an Expense transaction, it will subtract money from your account. If you create
an Income transaction, it will add money to your account. The account keeps track of all your transactions and
calculates the balance.

## Transfers

Transfers are a special kind of transactions. They don't have a category, but they have an origin account (From) and a
destination account (To), and also optionally a description. When you create a transfer, it will subtract money from the
origin account, and add money to the destination account.
